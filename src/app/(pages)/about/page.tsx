      Masons started in a coffee shop at 2AM. Three teenage devs sat huddled
      over half-dead laptops, half-full cups of bitter Turkish coffee, and fully
      charged dreams.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Back then, they were barely 16. Still figuring out what a for loop was,
      still learning to walk in the dev world without tripping over syntax
      errors. They had an idea: an app that could actually help people. So they
      mapped it out, picked a stack they barely knew, and dove in headfirst. For
      three months, they learned, built, dreamed. Everything felt like it was
      lining up.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Then one random day, just opening the Play Store to update Clash of Clans
      like any other normal teenager... bam. There it was. The exact same app.
      Built by someone else. Shipped. Polished. Everywhere. And it was good.
      Like, damn, hats-off kind of good. It crushed in Egypt. That sting? Yeah,
      it hurt. But respect where it&apos;s due. They got beat fair and square.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
      After that, life kicked in. One dev dipped. School got hectic. The dream
      went into deep freeze for a while. Third secondary, finals, the chaos of
      teenhood. Masons went quiet.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
      But legends don&apos;t stay dormant forever.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
      They graduated highschool. Life shifted. Seif crossed paths with two
      powerhouses: Ahmed Khalid, better known as Z3ln, and Sherif Lotfy, aka
      Sizif. Meanwhile, Abdelaziz met Omar Waleed in a different corner of the
      college cosmos. And just like that, the universe tossed a new challenge
      their way: NASA Space Apps Cairo 2023. That was the spark.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Seif called in the cavalry: his cousin Omar Ellaban. The puzzle pieces
      locked in. Six minds, six stories, one wild idea. For the first time, the
      Mighty Founding Six stood assembled.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
      When Rafiqi came into view, something shifted. The mission got real. They
      searched, reached out, brought new people into the fold. Each one brought
      a different background, a new way of thinking, skills the OGs didn&apos;t
      have. And that&apos;s what made the team powerful as hell. Not clones, but
      a crew of misfits with heart, grit, and range. Every one of them unique as
      hell.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
      From there, it was never about the hype. Not about slapping
      &quot;AI-powered&quot; on a landing page just to raise eyebrows. They
      weren&apos;t here for billion-dollar nothings.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
      They were here to build real stuff that mattered. Sometimes that meant AI
      that actually understood the context of a conversation, not just spit out
      buzzwords. Other times it was about infrastructure that didn&apos;t fall
      apart when 50,000 users showed up at once. Always, always, it was about
      putting people before ego.
