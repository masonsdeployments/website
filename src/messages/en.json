  "About": {
    "heroIntro": "Masons started in a coffee shop at 2AM. Three teenage devs sat huddled over half-dead laptops, half-full cups of bitter Turkish coffee, and fully charged dreams.",
    "heroStory1": "Back then, they were barely 16. Still figuring out what a for loop was, still learning to walk in the dev world without tripping over syntax errors. They had an idea: an app that could actually help people. So they mapped it out, picked a stack they barely knew, and dove in headfirst. For three months, they learned, built, dreamed. Everything felt like it was lining up.",
    "heroStory2": "Then one random day, just opening the Play Store to update Clash of Clans like any other normal teenager... bam. There it was. The exact same app. Built by someone else. Shipped. Polished. Everywhere. And it was good. Like, damn, hats-off kind of good. It crushed in Egypt. That sting? Yeah, it hurt. But respect where it's due. They got beat fair and square.",
    "heroStory3": "After that, life kicked in. One dev dipped. School got hectic. The dream went into deep freeze for a while. Third secondary, finals, the chaos of teenhood. Masons went quiet.",
    "heroStory4": "But legends don't stay dormant forever.",
    "heroStory5": "They graduated highschool. Life shifted. Seif crossed paths with two powerhouses: Ahmed Khalid, better known as Z3ln, and Sherif Lotfy, aka Sizif. Meanwhile, Abdelaziz met Omar Waleed in a different corner of the college cosmos. And just like that, the universe tossed a new challenge their way: NASA Space Apps Cairo 2023. That was the spark.",
    "heroStory6": "Seif called in the cavalry: his cousin Omar Ellaban. The puzzle pieces locked in. Six minds, six stories, one wild idea. For the first time, the Mighty Founding Six stood assembled.",
    "heroStory7": "When Rafiqi came into view, something shifted. The mission got real. They searched, reached out, brought new people into the fold. Each one brought a different background, a new way of thinking, skills the OGs didn't have. And that's what made the team powerful as hell. Not clones, but a crew of misfits with heart, grit, and range. Every one of them unique as hell.",
    "heroStory8": "From there, it was never about the hype. Not about slapping \"AI-powered\" on a landing page just to raise eyebrows. They weren't here for billion-dollar nothings.",
    "heroStory9": "They were here to build real stuff that mattered. Sometimes that meant AI that actually understood the context of a conversation, not just spit out buzzwords. Other times it was about infrastructure that didn't fall apart when 50,000 users showed up at once. Always, always, it was about putting people before ego.",
